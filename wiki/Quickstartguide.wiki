#summary Page outlining how to get GRAF running for potential clients

= Quick Start Guide =

== Downloading and Installing a Version Control Client ==

In order to obtain a copy of all the files needed to run and use GRAF, a version control client will be needed to extract these off the Google code repository. A simple svn client used by some of the team members is tortoise svn which can be found here: 
 * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/tortoisesvn/files/Application/1.6.10/TortoiseSVN-1.6.10.19898-win32-svn-1.6.12.msi/download TortoiseSVN]

Download this program by clicking the ‘save file’ button and selecting an appropriate location to save it, such as the downloads or desktop folders. Once downloaded locate and double click the file to initiate the installer. Follow the prompts generated by the installer to allow the program to finish its installation. 

== Checking out the Source Code ==

Now that tortoise has been installed one can checkout a copy of the GRAF source code from the Google code repository.  To do this, create a new folder in a logical place that you will remember. Once inside this folder right click the mouse and a list of options should<br /> appear similar to the following:<br /> 
 
Select the SVN Checkout option which will bring up the following box:<br />
 
In the’ URL of repository’ section copy the link from [http://code.google.com/p/graf-framework/source/checkout Source code] and paste. The Checkout directory should have automatically been filled out by the program and should point to the folder that you are currently inside.  If this is not the case, using the ‘...’  navigate to the desired folder. Press the ‘ok’ button to now checkout the most current revision of the repository.
