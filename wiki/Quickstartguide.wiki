== Downloading and Installing a Version Control Client ==

In order to obtain a copy of all the files needed to run and use GRAF, a version control client will be needed to extract these off the Google code repository. A simple svn client used by some of the team members is tortoise svn which can be found here: 
 * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/tortoisesvn/files/Application/1.6.10/TortoiseSVN-1.6.10.19898-win32-svn-1.6.12.msi/download TortoiseSVN]

Download this program by clicking the ‘save file’ button and selecting an appropriate location to save it, such as the downloads or desktop folders. Once downloaded locate and double click the file to initiate the installer. Follow the prompts generated by the installer to allow the program to finish its installation.
