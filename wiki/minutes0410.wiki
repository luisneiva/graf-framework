#summary Minutes for team meeting 4-Oct-2010

= Progress Reports & Task Setting =

Cameron - finding errors in GRAF
  * GRAF opens behind Eclipse
  * invoice test
    * change an attribute to something different - it creates an association
    * make an attribute anything other than the string it's supposed to be - the attribute will disappear
    * what happens when incorrectly naming one end of an association? Nothing
    * create two associations betweeen objects - the text and lines perfectly overlap
  * TODO finish Shayne's complex model, find errors in new functionality

Oscar
  * setting times for next meetings (Wednesday afternoon)
  * reviewing notes from presentation discussions with mentor & client
  * what could the group have used at the beginning of the year that we didn't have
