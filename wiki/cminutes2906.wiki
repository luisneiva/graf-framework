<br>Time: 3pm
<br>Duration: 30 minutes

  * The success criteria are vague to leave it up to the team how to implement them.

== First success criteria dot point ==
   * This first dot point in the success criteria can be achieved by doing 2 things:
1. For each UML action we implement as a rule, we should write it up somewhere. There should be an image of the rule (using green, blue and red colours; not a before and after) and a description of what it does. Greg will look at this. <br><br>
2. If 1 is completed then adding a model to GRAF will fulfil dot point 1 of the success criteria
  * The rule images should be automatically generated from our file that contains the rules
== Second success criteria dot point ==
  * For the second dot point in the success criteria we need to produce a tutorial that teaches UML.
  * This will focus on the xtUML part of UML - class, object and state diagrams.
  * Necessarily, this will mention the problems with UML.
  * GRAF is not the focus of the tutorial.
