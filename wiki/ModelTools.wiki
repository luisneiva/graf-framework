Last year (2009) the microwave model (linkify later) used to demonstrate the progress the team had made with GRAF was created by manually editing an XML tree. This is a time consuming process. As GRAF will be hopefully demonstrating multiple models this year a semi(or ideally wholly) automated process to produce models in XMI is required.

The tools investigated include:

=== Free ===
BOUML
  * Less user friendly than other tools
  * Allows for Eclipse specific output format but State Diagrams don't correctly nest with Classes creating an error when GRAF tries to load the .uml file
ARGOUML
  * XMI files that are output are not specific to Eclipse
Visual Paradigm SDE Community Edition
  * Lacks the XMI output required to feed models into GRAF
  * Is available as an Eclipse plugin that allows the editing of UML models graphically
Topcased
  * Allows for output in Eclipse specific format
  * 

=== Paid ===
Enterprise Architect
  * Requires an Eclipse plugin as standard edition outputs XMI files that are not specific to Eclipse (unsure if this plugin would even allow this)

Visual Paradigm SDE
  * Modellers edition required to output XMI files

== What we ended up with ==

A combination of Visual Paradigm SDE Community Edition Eclipse plugin and Topcased allows for the creation of UML models and their associated State Diagrams in a format allows GRAF to display the classes and their associated attributes. Unfortunately, no solution that allows for action language to be entered directly into the State Diagrams was found.
