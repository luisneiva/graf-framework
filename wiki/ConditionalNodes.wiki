= Conditional Nodes =

Conditional Nodes are a way of doing if statements in UML. We have implemented them in GRAF, but there's some ideosyncracies.

== How to use a Conditional Node ==


The above image shows how conditional nodes fit in the UML file. The Conditional Node must have a Clause. The body and the test fields fields in the clause are the important ones. I don't think Body Output does anything. In the case of if x then y, x is the Test and y is the Body.

== How Conditional Nodes are implemented ==
In GRAF only the execution of an action will change the graph, except for conditional nodes. If the condition returns false then we need to make it impossible to execute the action. We do this by deleting the _executable_ edge in the graph. Thus we have changed the graph without executing an action.

We check whether a Conditional Node test is evaluating to true or false by examining the _result_ edge from the Conditional Node in the graph. If it points to a node called _true_ then it's evaluated as true. ODAction.java does most of this stuff.

== Current limitations ==
  * Conditional nodes are only tested on single actions, not whole activities
  * There's no if-elseif-elseif-else implementation. Just if x then y.
