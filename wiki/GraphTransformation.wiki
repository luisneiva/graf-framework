== Graph Transformation - Unresolved issues==

GRAF aims to have its implementation of UML extendable by adding more graph transformation rules, not adding more code. However, there are two outstanding issues that need to be addressed in the code before GRAF requires only rule changes.

=== Association centre labels ===
Currently, the graphs of GRAF store the end labels of associations but not the centre label. Certain state machine actions involve getting associations by their centre label. To make this work, the ModelToGraph implementation and some rules would have to be changed to use a representation in graphs that features the association ends.
