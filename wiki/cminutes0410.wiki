= Mentor Meeting =
Date: 8/10/10
<br>Location: Raj's office
<br>Present: Oscar, Stephen, Alice, Greg and Raj
<br>Time: 2pm
<br>Duration: 1 hour

== Discussion of meeting with Stephen Mellor ==
  * ALF could be really important to the project next year
  * ALF should be the higher level language in our planned _model generator tool_
    * We don't want to make this tool if Mellor + co make their own shiny, more robust version at the same time
      * Unless we have the advantage of being free and open
        * But it wouldn't be nice to steal Mellor + co's profits from his own tool
    * Maybe Mellor + co need a team of developers to make the tool -> next year's team?

== Preshowcase Presentations ==
  * We need to email Lynette to get to go first in the presentations so that Raj can make it
  * Considered the pros and cons of tongue-in-cheek CEA mock explosion video
    * Plan as if we're not going to do this, and only put it in if it works really well
  * Show the ambiguous model, ask for a hand count of who thinks it will go left, who thinks it will go right

== General stuff ==
  * We need to email Greg a distributable package so he can try everything and get it working
