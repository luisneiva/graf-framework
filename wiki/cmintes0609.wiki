== Review ==

Booked time for Monday 13th September, 1420-1600

== Progress Report ==
  * added all of Greg's models
    * gave up looking for a tool to automate this entirely – adopted a hybrid method of hand-creating and use of plugins
    * simple model: done
    * elevator model: done/close
    * TE00: close
    * Invoicer: requires if-statements, and some pseudocode – this second element might take time
  * working on adding the functionality for Greg's models
    * state machine regions
    * if statements
    * mealy notation
    * methods
  * finished looking at other animators and other tools
    * none of the free tools were working
  * spoke to 
    * Shayne, as a potential user of GRAF as an educational tool
doesn't mind that GRAF provides low-level detail
      * hand-creating models not a problem because he can use only one or two that we make for him
      * requires timers
        * do we have the time to implement this?
    * Annette
      * liked that it was an animator
      * gave a list of features – bigger than Shayne's, so we're not going to implement it now. But it demonstrates that there is a need – not just a 'solution without a problem'
      * but Annette's not a customer at the moment
  * need to prepare the project for the next set of users and developers - "hand-over"
    * give Raj and Greg access to googlecode
    * put up instructions/tutorials
    * not that onerous, but we should start working on it now
    * Finishing the Invoicer model could be a learning-curve task for next year's team

== Discussion of review ==
  * we should be able to finish most of the work we've started
  * tactically it might be worth concentrating on Shayne's model – getting a user is a priority for the project, for feedback to the group and as a technology transfer from Greg's thesis to the 'real world'
  * request that Raj looks at the wiki on googlecode, try looking at GRAF himself
  * they might raise meta-level 'team' issues eg group cooperation 
  * clarify that Raj's absence didn't affect the project too much, cite mitigation techniques

== Next meeting with Greg ==
  * not before the review – contact via emails
  * ask Greg to look at GRAF from the standalone – can he animate a model to his satisfaction? This satisfies Raj's requirement of technology transfer from an academic perspective
  * not necessary that he attend the review – difficult to be involved via skype
== Problems? ==
  * the state transition problem
  * the difficulty is in AGG – it's too limited, but there might be a workaround
  * need to mention this to Greg
  * nb workload on the next seven weeks
