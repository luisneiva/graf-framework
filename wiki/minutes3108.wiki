<br>Duration: 1 hour

== How Shayne would like to use GRAF ==
  * Shayne would use this in 1 lecture and 1 tutorial
  * It doesn't matter that it's hard to set up new models. It's okay to just have one already set up and play with that
  * Shayne would like to start with an empty object diagram and create objects and link them
  * Shayne doesn't mind that the primitive UML actions are displayed
  * Timers would be good, perhaps with some way to pause them

== Overlap with other work ==
  * If statements are unimportant to Shayne
  * Methods are unimportant
  * State machine regions aren't needed at all
  * Mealy and Moore notation and hybrid would be really useful

== Action Items ==
  * Make uml files of Shayne's microwave model, both before and after adding new transition from state transition table
  * Devise !CreateLinkAction rule, to be used initialising microwave model
  * Do timers
