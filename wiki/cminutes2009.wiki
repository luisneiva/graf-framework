#summary Minutes

= Client Meeting =
Date: 20/9
<br>Location: Raj's office
<br>Present: Raj, Oscar, Stephen, Alice, Cameron, Hamish and Frank
<br>Time: 3pm
<br>Duration: 1 hour

== General ==
  * Greg will be away from work for 3 weeks starting next week but we can still phone him
  * Greg and Raj want the project to be continued next year
    * They'd like Annette to have a more active role - deciding what features should be implemented
  * We don't really know that animators like Rhapsody don't have some formalism stuff going on underneath. But the lack of transparency is just as bad.

== Preshowcase Presentation ==
  * At 10 minutes, it's just a sales pitch
  * Different levels to animators:
  # Surface
  # UML
  # Graphs
  # ... deeper levels
  * In other animators things can only be explained on the Surface level
  * GRAF's ability to go deeper is what makes it different, this is how we say GRAF is better than other animators

== Demo ==
  * Show the audience an example model and ask what happens next. Then show the obvious answer isn't the only one
  * A model with non-determinism might be the simplest way to show ambiguity. (Possibly the model on alliance, at the top of the models page)
  * There might not be time in the presentation to do this

== Possible slides ==
  * 1 slide on project motivation
  * 1 slide on why you would want to animate a model
  * 1 slide on why GRAF is the best animator (including it's free)
  * 1 or 2 slides on what we've done this year
