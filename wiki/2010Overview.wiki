= Introduction =

This page has been created to outline all the major events that have occurred throughout the life of the project during 2010 including, important decisions, road blocks, where the animator is at the end of 2010 and what is expected for the future years. This page will also contain useful links to most of the important project related documents.


= Decisions =

Throughout the year many decisions had to be made to get the project to its current stage.
The decisions that had the most impact on the project:
 * [http://code.google.com/p/graf-framework/wiki/UMLBPMNDecision xtUML vs BMPN] - xtUML emerging the winner with the animator being based on animating UML.
 * Early in the project when the problem with inputing models was discovered, there were talks of writing a parser to allow for much faster and easier input of models into GRAF, this was abandoned due to time and resource limitations and constraints.

= Road Blocks =

throughout the year roadblocks a plenty were encountered. The hardest most time consuming ones to over come were:

 * Inputting the small group of models provided to us by our clients into the GRAF animator proved quite a hard task. The reason for this was in all of the [http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/ EMF] (Eclipse Modeling Framework) there were no formats available to enable us to input a uml model with its associated action language in the one format. Two freely available tools were used in unison to enable us to create a workaround and input the models into the animator, Topcased and Visual Paradigm ([http://code.google.com/p/graf-framework/wiki/howToAddModels tutorial] on how to do this).

   As GRAF stands, each model to be input has to re-drawn in the right format. The action language then needs to be added, which in turn takes quite a lot of time. This in itself is too time consuming and complicated for an end user. This issue must be rectified in order for GRAF to be used in industry and is a major goal for future teams. 

 * One of the main ways we were going to show ambiguity in UML was to find two animators already available, animate the same model in both of them and compare the results. Theoretically as both of the animators would be based on the definition of UML, which is ambiguous, the implementers of the animators would have interpreted the definition differently, thus giving differing results when both animating the same model.
   
   Upon searching for available animators, many were found yet installing them and making them actually animate one our chosen models was another story. Of the model animators we found, we could not actually get any of them to animate any of our chosen models. This was due to licensing issues, complicated installation, and availability ([http://code.google.com/p/graf-framework/wiki/ModelAnim Animator Overview]).

= GRAF's current state =

 * Added Features for 2010 to enable us to animate the collection of models provided by the clients.
  * Mealy Notation
  * Methods
  * State machine regions
  * If statements
  * Convenience features 

 * GRAF is available as a runnable jar file.
 * Has registered interest for industry by Annette Vincent, Shayne Flint and Stephen Mellor.
 * Has 10 of the 36 behavioral UML [http://code.google.com/p/graf-framework/wiki/UMLTree#List_of_UML_Actions actions] implemented.
 
= Future Roadmap =

 * Create a way of inputing models such that an end user can easily add them into the animator
 * Implement the remaining behavior actions  Listed in the UML definition
 * Get the animator used in industry
 * Allow GRAF to cover languages other than UML
