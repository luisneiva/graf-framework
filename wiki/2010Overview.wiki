This page has been created to outline all the major events that have occurred throughout the life of the project during 2010 including, important decisions, road blocks, where the animator is at the end of 2010 and what is expected for the future years. This page will also contain useful links to most of the important project related documents.


= Decisions =

Throughout the year many decisions had to be made to get the project to its current stage.
The decisions that had the most impact on the project:
 * [http://code.google.com/p/graf-framework/wiki/UMLBPMNDecision xtUML vs BMPN] - xtUML emerging the winner with the animator being based on animating UML.
*

= Road Blocks =

throughout the year roadblocks a plenty were encountered. The hardest most time consuming ones to over come were:

 * Inputting the small group of models provided to us by our clients into the GRAF animator proved quite a hard task. The reason for this was in all of the [http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/ EMF] (Eclipse Modeling Framework) there were no formats available to enable us to input a uml model with its associated action language in the one format. Two freely available tools were used in unison to enable us to create a workaround and input the models into the animator, Topcased and Visual Paradigm ([http://code.google.com/p/graf-framework/wiki/howToAddModels tutorial] on how to do this).
