Information on various methods of source control that were considered for use.

Subversion (SVN)
  * Many readily available GUI's (Go TortoiseSVN)
  * Platform portable
  * Already available
  * [http://cs.anu.edu.au/students/comp2500 COMP2500 students] (all of us?) have already used SVN
  * Access to ANU SVN for all relevant parties is already there


Mercurial


CVS
  * Succeeded by SVN

=== Some random web pages related to source control ===
  * Mercurial vs SVN [http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Mercurial_vs._Subversion example]
  * [http://seeknuance.com/2008/07/06/mercurial-vs-subversion/ Small developer picking Source Control Tool (bit old but can see the thought process)]
  * Huge table with lots of info about Bazaar, CVS, Git, Mercurial and SVN is [http://versioncontrolblog.com/comparison/Bazaar/CVS/Git/Mercurial/Subversion/index.html here]

== Final decision ==
As an SVN server has been provided to us by the ANU, GRAF 2010 will be using that for all source control operations
