#Information on Source Control

== Source Control ==

Subversion (SVN)
* Many readily available GUI's (Go TortoiseSVN)
* Platform portable
* Already available
* 2500 students (all of us?) have already used SVN
* Access to ANU SVN for all relevant parties is already there

== Some random web pages i found ==
  * [http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Mercurial_vs._Subversion Mercurial vs SVN example]
  *[http://seeknuance.com/2008/07/06/mercurial-vs-subversion/ Small developer picking Source Control Tool (bit old but can see the thought process)]
  * Huge table with lots of info about Bazaar, CVS, Git, Mercurial and SVN is [http://versioncontrolblog.com/comparison/Bazaar/CVS/Git/Mercurial/Subversion/index.html here].

== Final decision ==
As an SVN server has been provided to us by the ANU, GRAF 2010 will be using that for all source control operations
