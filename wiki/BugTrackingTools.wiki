This is a dot-point comparison of some bug tracking tools which we might consider using. It is obviously an incomplete list - for a more detailed comparison, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue_tracking_systems this website].

In summary:
  * Bugzilla is a well-established product with lots of features but an awkward user interface; 
  * Trac is 'lightweight' with fewer features and good SVN integration;
  * JIRA is a good tool but requires a license;
  * Mantis has lots of features and a simple user interface, and is already known to the team;
  * Eventum is also a well-established product but seems to have a reputation for complex administration. 

=== Bugzilla ===
  * well known
  * open source (based on UNIX/LINUX)
  * 'mature', 'feature rich'
  * good for large projects, and can handle multiple projects
  * powerful and flexible
  * relatively simple bug entry with lots of information fields
  * requires verification of fixes
  * long, error-prone installation
  * hard-coded workflow
  * ugly and convoluted (but functional) user interface

  * Perl, mySQL or PostgreSQL, and a web server

=== Trac ===
  * lightweight
  * integration with SVN - allows direct browsing and referencing of repositories
  * open source
  * project overview features such as timelines
  * simple ticket creation
  * easy to use?
  * relatively simple installation?
  * fewer features than Bugzilla
  * limited reporting
  * no fix verification in workflow
	 
  * Python, mySQL or PostgreSQL or SQLite. Can run as a stand-alone server or be installed on a web server

=== JIRA ===
  * easy installation - can use its own or other databases
  * good, intuitive user interface
  * useful predefined news and search - simpler than Bugzilla
  * good for large and multiple projects
  * customisable, with lots of features

  * commercial - license costs $1,200 to $4,800 (may offer free licenses for open source projects)

=== Mantis ===
  * open source
  * runs on windows, linux and macOS
  * long install process (but relatively simple?)
  * lots of features, simple interface
  * reports exported in Excel and MSWord
  * easy admin
  * no client installation
  * has fix validation
  * previous experience

  * PostgreSQL, MySQL Server and MySQL with web-based IIS or Apache server 

=== Eventum ===
  * time-management feature
  * open source
  * good community support (used by mySQL team)
  * complex administration
  * annoying setup process - no default priority codes or issue types
  * full PHP application
  * runs on Apache or IIS and MySQL

  * MySQL, Apache/IIS with PHP installed

== Final Decision ==
It was decided to use the Google Code project's tracker to keep a record of issues encountered. This negates the need to set up, maintain and administrate a new system. This will require all new project members to be added into the project.
