#summary Minutes

= Stakeholder Meeting =
Date: 4/8/10
<br>Location: Ian Ross Building Room 221
<br>Present: Annette Vincent, Oscar, Stephen, Alice, Cameron, Hamish and Frank
<br>Time: 5pm
<br>Duration: 60 minutes

== Annette's work at ARC ==
  * They did use Kennedy Carter
  * They use class diagrams and state machines
  * One model has 100 classes, 20 of which have state machines, which use UML action language
  * They have now written their own model compiler in Java

== Annette's interest in GRAF ==
  * Bridgepoint and Kennedy Carter are really hard to use, especially the output during model animation
  * GRAF's use of graphs isn't a major selling point for Annette. She's fed up with Bridgepoint and Kennedy Carter and wants something easy to use
  * Annette would use GRAF more to test and understand a model than to come to an understanding with her peers on a model
  * Annette would use GRAF when it's done

== Features Annette would use ==
  * A system state editor, ie. the ability to change attributes and links in the middle of execution
  * A model verifier to check eg. that 1 to 1 associations aren't violated
  * Automatic testing, something like JUnit, automated
  * Annette liked the way how instances are initialised in a text file (.modeltest)
  * Annette uses models whose state machines have regions

  * Annette will ask around for contentious models, but misunderstanding models isn't the main problem
