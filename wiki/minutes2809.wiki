  * Developed plan, which will be put up somewhere

  * James doesn't think any company would have the time to spend using GRAF

== Decisions ==
  * We won't implement any "refresh" on if-statements returning false because it's clearer what's happening the way it is
  * We'll abandon proper object placement because we have no big models
