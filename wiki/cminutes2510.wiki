== Feedback on Presentation ==

  * Presenters were nervous
  * too understated - could have been more positive
    * James still not convinced, but says that the "reference" quality is still the most important aspect and should be emphasised

== Vital To-Dos ==

  * must have something that people can download and play with
  * for next year, 'future work' pages on wiki
  * Raj will look over the website and email feedback
  * Greg should go over the website and email feedback

== Problems ==

  * find a small UML model that is ambiguous. Greg suggests the model on p 67 of his thesis
  * Timer development aborted, but documented
  * Need 'seal of approval' from Greg as part of final submission
