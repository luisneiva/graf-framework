Graph outputs can be used for debugging and testing implementations. A graph output requires AGG package, Graphviz, and the bat script called dotToImg2.dot.
1. AGG package is stored under agg_V164 directory;
2. Graphviz can be found at: http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php;
3. The bat script is contained under GraphOutputs/conversionFiles. To run it, type the command: dotToImg2 stateX.dot
Note: stateX.dot stands for the dot file generated by GRAF, stored under GraphOutputs directory.

For example, the test case of the Elevator model is expecting that the Behaviour-Execution node has an Active-State edge to each state: state 5 and 10. And we can verify the testing case on the output graph.
