Date: 17/8/10
<br>Location: CSIT N110
<br>Present: Oscar, Alice and Frank
<br>Time: 1-6

== Mealy notation ==
  * Manually added an executable edge to enable transition-action
  * The action does appear in the GUI but for some reason it is greyed out
  * Emailed Frank the code to add the executable edge so he can investigate why it's not working as expected

== Methods & Constructors ==
  * Tried to find faithful interpretation of TE00 in UML2
  * UML has no explicit constructors, but you can use static methods/operations in classes as the same thing
  * Methods should be implemented as parallel to AcceptEvent + SendSignal
  * Emailed Greg about what to do
