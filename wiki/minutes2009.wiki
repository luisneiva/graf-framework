== Review discussion ==
  * We should ask James what his problem with the project is

== Preshowcase presentation discussion ==
  * Seeking industrial support, it would be especially good if GRAF got to do the showcase
  * It's easier to appeal to students - UML, Shayne's course
  * It's harder to appeal to industry-people because they may not know so much about UML
    * We can engage them by talking about the industry vs academic perspective of GRAF
  * It's not clear how much detail we should go into with technical detail - how graphs work
