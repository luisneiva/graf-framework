<br>Present: Oscar, Stephen, Alice, Cameron and Frank
<br>Time: 5pm
<br>Duration: 1 hour

== Post-review discussion ==

The examiners didn't seem to be too worried about the content or work of the project, but raised planning for the new 'education' goal/direction - and especially whether we had enough time to complete this goal, given our current stage.

=== WBS review ===

Given the new 'education' direction, what needs to change about the WBS? Is there anything else that needs to change?

New sections/ changes:
  * GRAF-UML tutorial to be given its own section.
  * Presentations to stakeholders and potential sponsors (Annette, Shayne and Clive) should be added.

The first new functionality to be added will be the ability to handle methods.

== Task allocation ==

  * Frank: add capability to display methods to the GUI,
  * Alice: extend the graph search to look for methods,
  * Cameron: add a model suitable for a UML tutorial to GRAF,
  * Hamish: test accuracy of GRAF documentation.

To be organised:
  * Meeting with Annette to ask for a model and demonstrate GRAF.
    ** Book N101.
  * Meeting with Shayne to pitch GRAF as an educational tool.
