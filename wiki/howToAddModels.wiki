_This is the page where a more refined tutorial for putting models into GRAF will be placed._

== Installation ==

Install [http://www.visual-paradigm.com/product/sde/ec/ Visual Paradigm Community Edition SDE for Eclipse]. A user guide is [http://www.visual-paradigm.com/support/documents/sdejavauserguide.jsp provided].  

Once this is completed install [http://www.topcased.org/ Topcased] org.topcased.sdk-3.3.0.zip (a little bit under 30megs) by dragging and dropping the downloaded files into the Eclipse plugins directory. 

== Usage ==

There are 2 basic steps to adding models to GRAF:
  # Creating the model
  # Editing the models .uml file so that the architecture behind the transitions is recognised 

=== 1. How to create a new model ===

  * File
  * New
  * Project
  * Expand Topcased
  * Select Topcased Project
  * Expand project in project explorer, models folder should appear
  * Right click the models folder
  * New
  * Select UML model with TOPCASED
  * Name the new model
  * Open the .umldi file (graphical representation)
  * Common operations include:
    * To add classes click the class icon and then click the blank space to create a class. To rename the class by editing its name property - should be in the properties section on the right hand side of the screen. If this isnt there check you are in the Unimod perspective (top right of the screen)
    * To add a state machine double click on the class you want to build one for. A dialog box will appear. Select State Machine Diagram and click ok
    * When adding transitions use the 'External Transition' option - this is essential for your model to work within GRAF. Transitions are added by clicking on the 'from' class and dragging to the 'to' class. The lines can be edited to make the diagram more attractive by clicking on a point on the line and dragging that point on the line to wherever you see fit

==== Example ====

The State Machine for the Simple Microwave, based on Shayne Flints lecture notes looks like this:

=== 2. Editing the .uml file to make it work with GRAF ===

_Use Franks Guide Here_

*How to create .uml models to work in GRAF using Topcased (more to come: activity under states)*
  * Open the models .uml file in the UML model editor by:
    * right click on the file
    * open with
    * UML model editor
  * Create a signal for each transition by:
    * right clicking at a package 
    * new child
    * packaged elements 
    * signal (press 's' to fast track to elements beginning with s)
  * Specify a unique name for each signal
  * Create a receive signal event for each signal by:
    * right clicking at a package 
    * new child 
    * packaged elements 
    * receive signal event (press 'r' to fast track to elements beginning with r)
  * Specify the related signal (one of those created before) and a unique name for each receive signal event

_More To Come_
  * Expand all nodes under packages, classes, state machines, regions, and transitions.
  * Add a trigger to each transition by right clicking at a transition -> new child -> trigger -> trigger
  * Specify an event (choose a receive signal event) and name for a trigger

Remember to put: name the receive operations as you would like them to be displayed in the interface
