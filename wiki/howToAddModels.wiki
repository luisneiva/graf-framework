_This is the page where a more refined tutorial for putting models into GRAF will be placed._

== Installation ==

Install [http://www.visual-paradigm.com/product/sde/ec/ Visual Paradigm Community Edition SDE for Eclipse]. A user guide is [http://www.visual-paradigm.com/support/documents/sdejavauserguide.jsp provided]. Open Eclipse and create a 

Once this is completed install [http://www.topcased.org/ Topcased] org.topcased.sdk-3.3.0.zip (a little bit under 30megs) by dragging and dropping the downloaded files into the Eclipse plugins directory. 

== Usage ==

There are 2 basic steps to adding models to GRAF:
  # Creating the model
  # Editing the models .uml file so that the architecture behind the transitions is recognised 

=== 1. How to create a new model ===

  * File
  * New
  * Project
  * Expand Topcased
  * Select Topcased Project
  * Expand project in project explorer, models folder should appear
  * Right click the models folder
  * New
  * Select UML model with TOPCASED
  * Name the new model
  * Open the .umldi file (graphical representation)
  * Common operations include
    * To add classes click the class icon and then click the blank space to create a class. To rename the class by editing its name property - should be in the properties section on the right hand side of the screen. If this isnt there check you are in the Unimod perspective (top right of the screen)
    * To add a state machine double click on the class you want to build one for. A dialog box will appear. Select State Machine Diagram and click ok
    * When adding transitions use the 'External Transition' option - this is essential for your model to work within GRAF. Transitions are added by clicking on the 'from' class and dragging to the 'to' class. The lines can be edited to make the diagram more attractive by clicking on a point on the line and dragging that point on the line to wherever you see fit
