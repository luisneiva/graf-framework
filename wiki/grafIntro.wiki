=== Oven Model ===

=== Academic Models: TE00, Invoicer, Elevator, Racer ===
For the original academic papers these came from [https://alliance.anu.edu.au/portal click here.]

==== Elevator ====
This model uses multiple State Machine Regions.

==== Racer ==== 
A simple UML model

==== Invoicer ====
At the end of 2010 this model was not fully implemented.

==== TE00 ====
Uses the !CreateObjectAction UML Action. TE00 !CreateLinkAction is a variation that demonstrates !CreateLinkAction.

=== Microwave Model ===
The 4 versions of this model are variations of the following:

!MicrowaveWithInteger contains an action to increment the temperature, the others don't. !MicrowaveError and !MicrowaveExtended were just used for testing. !MicrowaveTimer was used for our old failed implementation of [GRAFTimers timers], and is now pretty much useless.

=== If Test ===
This model was used to test the teams implementation of if statements within GRAF. The Invoice objects create an object depending on a boolean value in the Invoicer object they're connected to.
