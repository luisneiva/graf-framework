== Summary ==
  * Described GRAF to Stephen
  * Stephen described [http://www.omg.org/spec/ALF/1.0/Source/ ALF] to us
  * Discussed UML being a mess

== Key points ==
  * Stephen would like to be able take apart UML and start again, building it properly with a formal definition.
  * Stephen thinks there is a point to GRAF
  * In 18 months, UML 2.5 will come out which is supposed to be a simplification
    * But UML 2.0 was also supposed to be a simplification and that was more complicated then the previous versions
    * But UML 2.5 is being developed by people who have an interest in it being usable
  * ALF will have actions sequential by default unless the user explicitly says it's parallel
  * [http://www.magicdraw.com MagicDraw] is a proper tool for making UML models that should be exportable to Eclipse
  * [fuml.modeldriven.org Foundational UML]
  * ALF will have 3 compliance levels
  # You can type into it (looks like Java)
  # Parses syntax (looks like OCL)
  # Generates the model
