== Report to James ==

  * Meeting with Shayne
    * would like both versions of the microwave models. Requires:
      * CreateLinkAction
      * Timer
    * issues with state machine transitions - AGG limitation
      * requires inelegant solution

== Prep for project review ==
  * have everyone speak
  * demonstration of GRAF

== Progress reports ==
Frank
  * if statements working, but not displayed correctly
  * modify the GUI to same the filepath of the model so that the filechooser doesn't pop up every time
Hamish
  * other assignments
  * still got testing for the action calls and positioning the objects on the screen
Alice
  * still need to do reply action, resolve pin problems
  * communication model powerpoint
Cameron
  * making the models for Shayne
  * made a powerpoint presentation on GPME useage
== Discussion ==
  * timelines - we have 7-8 weeks left
  * showcase
  * plan for winding down - what deliverables do we have?
  * what will they ask in the review
    * how well what we have matches up with what the clients wanted
    * looking for something that could animate more models than what it could do at the beginning of the year
    * need a transition/closing plan
      * success criteria: need to state them and demonstrate whether they have been met
      * need documentation of GRAF for the new team, and planning for it (need a transition plan with justificiation - do we need to put it on googlecode, do we need a hard copy? Yes, for submission)
      * state plan for closing in the review, including detail on all the activities
        * stuff that Shayne needs - including training
        * stuff that the future team needs - the code structure, 'how to debug GRAF' on a powerpoint or similar
        * including 'how to' guides for installing GRAF, perhaps present the materian in order of difficulty
    * need to leave time for testing - test cases, expected outcomes
    * need to be able to test the success criteria

== Plan for the project review ==
  * what we've each been doing (don't get bogged down)
  * deliverables
  * hand-over plan?

== Project task assignment ==
  * Alice: review talk about method stuff (and what it's adding to the project)
  * Cameron: the stuff for Shayne and the general 'using GRAF as an educational tool'
  * Frank: coding tasks - if statements, regions, methods, properties (mention what it's adding to GRAF)
  * Hamish: documentation, testing

== Delivarables ==
  # the application
  # user-level tutorial (audience - Shayne Flint)
  # developer-level tutorial
  # demonstration presentation of the potential use of the animator in model-driven development
    * goal is to attract industrial sponsor - did we satisfy this by meeting with Annette?
    * [in client meeting] probably close enough
