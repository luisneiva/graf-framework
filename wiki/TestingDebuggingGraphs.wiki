#labels Phase-QA
Graph outputs can be used for debugging and testing implementations. A graph output requires _AGG_ package, _Graphviz_, and the bat script called dotToImg2.dot.
  * _AGG_ package can be found under agg_V164 directory.
  * _Graphviz_ can be found at: http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php
  * The bat script is contained under graphOutputs -> conversionFiles. To run it, type the command: dotToImg2 stateX.dot

Note: stateX.dot stands for the dot file generated by GRAF, stored under graphOutputs directory.

Background:
The Elevator model contains state machine regions. In order to implement this, we needed to make Graf able to read multiple states in one object. 

The Active-State edge without regions:

The Active-State edge appears in the graph when taking into account regions:

Code changes: We changed the code in the GraphToObjDiag class (under the package: model/modelTransformer).
  * First, use ListGraph.toTrace to trace from elevator1 to Top-Region following ‘execution’ edge, ‘behaviour’ edge, and ‘region’ edge (as marked in blue). 
  * Second, trace to all sub-regions when there exist multiple regions following ‘subvertex’ edge and ‘region’ edge. In this example, it will find Elevator-Region and Elevator2-Region (as marked in pink).
