Graph outputs can be used for debugging and testing implementations. A graph output requires _AGG_ package, _Graphviz_, and the bat script called dotToImg2.dot.
  * _AGG_ package can be found under agg_V164 directory.
  * _Graphviz_ can be found at: http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php
  * The bat script is contained under graphOutputs -> conversionFiles. To run it, type the command: dotToImg2 stateX.dot

Note: stateX.dot stands for the dot file generated by GRAF, stored under graphOutputs directory.

For example, the test case of the Elevator model is expecting that the Behaviour-Execution node has an Active-State edge to each state: state 5 and 10. And we can verify the testing case on the output graph.
