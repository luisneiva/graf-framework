= Review 3 =
Date: 13/9/10
<br>Location: Ian Ross Seminar Room
<br>Present: Shayne, Lynette, Raj, James, Oscar, Stephen, Alice, Cameron, Hamish and Frank
<br>Time: 2:30pm
<br>Duration: 1.5 hours

== Discussion ==
  * Entering models was surprisingly the biggest problem in Raj's opinion.
  * James wants to see state machines when he animates a state machine but Shayne is happy just seeing the model
  * Helping Shayne is just a side project. The mainline is still making the models for Greg
  * (You can have static state machines)
  * Next year's parser could be based on the new action language thing coming out
  * Steve Mellor's coming to visit. Shayne will arrange a meeting.

== Action Items ==
  * Duress testing must distinguish startup time vs model loading time.
  * We need to get eclipse's state machine diagram generation working to satisfy people like James who want to see the state machine
  * Constructors
    * Raj suggested if this is a problem with UML we should fix it
    * Check the UML forums for opinions on static methods
  * Static methods should be added to the future works section
