Introduction

See Business Specifications, Vision and Scope document.
Glossary (incomplete)

    * The animator – The Graph-based Reference Animator Framework, the system that this document describes.
    * Eclipse – General-purpose integrated development environment that supports plugin extensions.
    * EMF – Eclipse Modelling Framework
    * System state - An instantaneous snapshot of some point during execution. The system state elements in the UML language the UML metamodel, a model and an instance combined.
    * System transition - A transformation of one system state to another.
    * Graph - A directed graph composed of nodes, as strings, and edges between nodes. Each edge has a label.
    * Graph transformation rule -
    * Rule application -

Product Functions (draft complete)

The system will:

   1. Be extended for a particular modelling language definition.
   2. Take a model in the extended language and its initial state.
   3. Then display the model's system state as defined by the language package.
   4. Provide a visualisation that captures the complete system state.
   5. Allow the user to select interactions to initiate
   6. Perform interactions following as graph transformations according to the language package's definition.
   7. Presented the new system state at the completion of each system state transition, rather than interaction.

Assumptions and Constraints ( Draft complete)

   1. The animator will execute as an Eclipse plugin and standalone application.
   2. The animator will use graph transformations to perform verifiable model state transitions.

Functional Requirements (incomplete)

   1. Graph transformations (draft complete)
         1. When input for a model and a system state is given, the animator will generate a graph which is equivalent to the input. Required to be definitive
         2. The graph will be of the type described by the language package.
         3. The annotated object diagram will always reflect exactly the meaning of the graph.
         4. The graph is not visible to the user.
         5. The graph will undergo graph transformations to transition from the current system state to the next.

Non-Functional Requirements (unchanged)

   1. Performance - our processing of graphs must be efficient given that the graphs will be very large. [perhaps we should come up with some well founded estimates here? eg, typical sized model, say 100 classes, half active, yielding model graph of 5000 nodes and system state of 20,000? -Greg]
         1. The time it takes the system to read in the model and process model-to-graph and graph-to-graph must not exceed 10 seconds for a model with 1 class, 1 state diagram, etc, etc. NOTE: these are random numbers I have pulled out from our current microwave example. Needs to validated with Greg. Eg processed under X seconds for Y UML diagrams, with Z state machines and W states, V actions, etc [10 milliseconds I'd say, 10 seconds for the 20,000 node graph -Greg]
         2. Must run on machine with at least X CPU speed [1Ghz], Y RAM [1Gb], [20Gb] Z hard drive space etc 
   2. Must be able to animate models produced from modelling tools including at least EMF and Rational Rose. [ the standard .xmi format might be a more appropriate target - EMF and Rose both nominally use this]
   3. Must run Eclipse/EMF of at least version 3.2.
   4. Must run on at least Java version 1.5.
   5. Extensibility - the system must be built so that future teams can easily build and add new functions upon the current implementation.
   6. Usability - the system must be intuitive and easy to use by users. (NOTE: this needs to be reviewed by team and validated by Greg) [ a measurable version of this goal would be good]
         1. The time to learn and be productive with the system must not exceed 2 days [ I'd say 2 hours, -Greg]
         2. All system actions can be done within less than 5 mouse clicks [? certainly the common ones, but really common ones we should aim for 1 click (if that doesn't infringe Amazon's patent) ]
         3. There will be help documentation on all possible actions.
         4. The language used will be easy to understand and contains no jargon (eg our target user base are professional modellers, so they do not need to know the details of graphs, graph transformations, etc) [ some UML jargon is probably acceptable if necessary ]

UML sample language requirements

The UML language definition sample will:

    * Display a system state as a object diagram with annotations to capture the complete system state (for example, the actions, events and activities describing the core of UML interactions)
    * Be the reference for instructional and tutorial documentation on extending the animator to modelling languages.

User-Interface Requirements (unchanged)

When user operations cannot be completed, an error message is shown describing the nature of the error and how it can be solved.)
Future Work (may not need changing)

This section contains features of the system that would be desired by modellers using the system, but does not fit into the current scope of this project.
User Interaction

    * Ability to undo any number of system transitions
    * Ability to filter displayed system state by for example: class, instance, criteria, etc.
    * More sophisticated view navigation, for example: following links to objects, automatic scrolling to non-visible objects, etc.

Functionality

    * Further definition of graph transformation rules to support the full UML language.
    * Ability to generate a sequence diagram of executed system trace.
    * Ability to verify if the executed system trace satisfies an input sequence diagram.

Automation

    * Ability to execute a pre-determined trace. For example this could be restored from a previous execution.

System State Verification

    * Verify if the input system state is valid.
    * Verify if Object Constraint Language constraints are met.

References (unchanged)

[Any references we need to make.]

(Greg says: this section will be important. As well as the obvious stuff like the UML definition, we may want to cite our own writings where we have done a bit of research and reached some conclusions.)
