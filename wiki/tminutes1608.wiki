#summary Minutes

= Technical Meeting =
Date: 16/8/10
<br>Location: CSIT N110
<br>Present: Oscar, Alice Frank
<br>Time: 3:30pm
<br>Duration: 30 minutes

== Regions ==
  * 2 regions at the same level probably requires no change
  * 1 region in a region would be very complicated but the approach we took for AddExecutableEdges might work

== Mealy notation ==
  * *Links != Transitions*
  * Possibly everything will work by itself once we add executable edges to the actions
  * If so, then we only need to add a modified version of AddExecutableEdges

== Task assignment ==
  * To be decided at meeting tomorrow
