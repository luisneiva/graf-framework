=Creating a Distributable Tarball=

Ideally, this is done in **[http://nixos.org/ NIX], but can also be done with WinRAR. The process contains three steps:
  # Create the JAR file
  # Tarball and Bzip the JAR along with the required files to run
  # Upload it to Google code
These steps will be outlined below.

==Step 1: Create the JAR==

Right click the GRAF project in Eclipse and click "Export"

This should bring up the following menu:

Ensure the option "Runnable JAR file" is selected and click next. The following screen is next:

Ensure that the JAR will be in the GRAF folder "dist" and that required libraries will be packaged into the JAR. Hit finish and it should create the JAR

==Step 2: Tarball the JAR and the required files==

If you are running **NIX, there is a script in the GRAF folder you can run called "create_tarball.sh" in the main GRAF folder. If you are using WinRAR, then create a new archive (RAR shouldn't matter, so long as the link on the main page is kept current) and be sure to include
  * /dist/graf.jar - The GRAF runnable JAR 
  * GTSRules.ggx and GTSRulesSeq.xml - The rules files
  * UMLMetamodel - The UML Metamodel folder
  * Properties.txt - The properties file
  * Models - The models folder
  * !GraphOutputs - Or at least the conversionFiles folder in !GraphOutputs

==Step 3: Upload the archive onto Google code==

The final step simply involves uploading the file into the "Downloads" section on Google code and updating all the download links
