#summary stuff that won't happen in 2010

Some of GRAF's future ambitions include: 
 * Animation Features
  ** Intelligent display navigation (a minimap)
  ** Display filtering (particularly important with large models)
  ** Support for automated animation
 * Potential application of graph logic to:
  ** Verify safety properties of system states
  ** Analyse and enforce model constraints (such as Object Constraint Language queries)
  ** Analyse feasibility of given system traces (for example, can a model satisfy a given  sequence diagram)
 * Development of reference animators for languages in need, including continuing development of our UML reference animator.
 * Engagement of many different educational institutions to help develop a tool used for modelling classes
 * Creating .uml files more easily - we could use annotations in the state machines in Topcased to represent actions and then add to GRAF the ability to translate these annotations into the proper actions
