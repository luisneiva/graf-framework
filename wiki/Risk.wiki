Only critical and high threat level risks will be mitigated

=== Mitigation of critical and high risks ===
===== The models from Greg can't be entered into GRAF =====
*Action:* Reduce likelihood, reduce impact <br>
The team will look for other models that serve the same purpose but are more compatible with GRAF. The team will make it a priority to find out what is needed to add the 4 models so it will become clear how feasible it is.

===== 2 animators give the same results ====
*Action:* Reduce impact<br>
The team will try to get more than two animators working. We will also look for other ways to demonstrate the problems with a lack of formality.

===== Project doesn't meet client's needs =====
*Action:* Reduce impact and likelihood<br>
Obviously avoiding this risk is equivalent to making the project as successful as possible. Beyond, trying to make the project a success, the group will also focus on creating documentation for whoever continues the project next year. That way, even if the project does not meet the client's needs, there will be a good chance of it being successful next year.

===== Can't convince anyone of the usefulness of GRAF =====
*Action:* Reduce likelihood<br>
Though the group can always present GRAF in the best light possible, this may not convince everyone that the concept behind GRAF is worthwhile. Furthermore, though this risk will affect the team, it is largely up to the clients to address this.

===== Greg or Raj can no longer be involved as much =====
*Action:* Reduce impact<br>
The team needs to develop a concrete, unchanging plan based on the success criteria. We cannot base the week's/month's activities on what happened at the last client meeting. That way, the team will have a plan whether or not the clients are available.

===== A team member leaves temporarily or permanently =====
*Action:* Reduce impact<br>
All the team can do is make sure that if this does happen, no information or skills are lost. For example, all files will be kept online.

===== Free UML animators don't work =====
*Action:* Reduce impact<br>
The lack of free UML animators will prove a point in itself. The team will investigate alternatives with the client.

=== Mitigation of risks that used to be critical or high risk ===

===== Contacted stakeholders have no use for GRAF, have no ambiguous models =====
*Action:* Reduce probability/transfer risk<br>
~~First, the team will make it a priority to find out as soon as possible if this will be the case. Second, the team will consider other uses for GRAF and Graph Transformation Theory.~~
This risk did not eventuate Clive Boughton saw the value in GRAF, he had had situations where GRAF would have been beneficial and he would like to use the finished GRAF product. 

===== Work to make GRAF useable is unattainable in 2010 =====
*Action:* Reduce impact<br>
~~The team will seek to make connections with interested parties so that someone will continue to work on GRAF after 2010. This may or may not involve having the project run again as an ANU Software Engineering project.~~
GRAF doesn't have to be _useable_ by 2011. Only the team needs to be able to use it to demonstrate problems in other animators.

===== There are no free UML animators =====
*Action:* Reduce impact<br>
The team will look into other ways to demonstrate ambiguities in models. The team will consider other approaches to acquire animators.

===== No action language builder =====
*Action:* Reduce impact<br>
~~The team will make it a priority to determine whether any tool supports easily adding action language commands to a state machine. If none can be found, then we will make it part of the project to develop our own application to do so. GRAF cannot be used without a state machine with action commands and it is unreasonable to expect anyone to seriously use GRAF if they need to manually add each primitive UML action.~~ We reduced the impact of this to zero by deciding not to use an action language builder.
