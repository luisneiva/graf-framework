This is the README file to the AGG system (Version 1.6.4).


*** REQUIREMENTS ***

To run this program, you will need the following:

Hardware and OS:  everything that can run java java 1.6.0

Software: java 1.6.0  see http://www.sun.com/software/java

Jar files: 
          agg_V164_classes.jar
and
          jgl3.1.0.jar  (Java Generic Libraries )
you will get with our AGG zip archive.


*** INSTALLATION ***

I guess you have decompressed our package. Otherwise I wonder
how you can read this README ;-)

Make sure that you have installed java properly.

To install AGG on UNIX/LINUX platform please use our script "install.sh".
To install AGG on WINDOW platform the script "agg.bat" can be helpful.

*** PLEASE NOTE ***
It is usful to have a local installation of the AGG software.
If you want to make the AGG installation as a root and 
to launch it as a normal user,
please do not change to the AGG root directory to run it.
In this case you will get problems to load a graph grammar from a file 
because AGG will try to write a needed temp file to the root directory
without permission to do this.
In this case you can create a link to the AGG application.

*** PLEASE NOTE ***
The current AGG version contains an extention of the graph layout, namely,
graph layout algorithms from Eclipse Zest Project. 
This extention is optional. 
To activate it the Zest graph layout JAR file
org.eclipse.zest.layouts_1.0.0.v20080226.jar from GEF-Zest-3.4.1.zip
should be added to the CLASSPATH setting. 
You can download this ZIP file from 
Eclipse GEF Downloads -> Zest+Draw2D -> Runtime
(href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/downloads/").

*** START ***

To start AGG on UNIX/LINUX just run: 	agg.sh

              or type:	java -Xmx1000m agg.gui.AGGAppl


*** Critical Pair Analysis in AGG *** 

To save time and memory you can compute critical pairs using command line:
	java -Xmx1000m agg.gui.AGGComputeCriticalPairs [C | D] name.ggx
or
	java -Xmx1000m agg.gui.AGGComputeCriticalPairs name.cpx

alternatively you can use:

	java -Xmx1000m agg.parser.ComputeCriticalPairs [C | D] name.ggx

Please run  
	java -Xmx1000m agg.parser.ComputeCriticalPairs  
without parameters to see the list of possible options.

*** PLEASE NOTE ***
	
You can also use the script "ccp.sh" on UNIX/LINUX platform
and "ccp.bat" on WINDOW. Please check the environment settings
of this script and pass it if needed.
