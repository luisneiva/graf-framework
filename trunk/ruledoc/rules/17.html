				<h2>
					Rationale
				</h2>
					<p>
						This implementation of the Action works by placing the contents of the output 
						pin of the method's nested Action on the the calling object (called sendingObject
						in the rule)'s behaviorExecution node, using an arc with the same name as the Reply
						Action's replyValue pin. 
					</p>
				<h2>
					Assumptions/Deviations from the Definition
				</h2>
					<p>
						The description of this Action is one of the most unclear in the Specification. Its
						placement in the model structure, and the way that it interacts with AcceptCallAction (including
						exactly what information is to constitute the 'returnInformation' - we use the CallEvent itself)
						are largely assumptions based on what we thought was logical.
					</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
						Currently, we only have models with one nested Action in their methods, but obviously there could be more. 
						Theoretically, this is not a problem for AcceptCallAction, or the execution of the nested actions themselves 
						on our implementation. However, the replyValue pin of ReplyAction has to hold "a list of pins containing the 
						reply values of the operation."
					</p>
					<p>
						This suggests that a future implementation might require a split of the rule into two parts - a Main part 
						(that removes the executable edge) and a second part that loops across the method, adding the replyValue
						arcs. Our implementation also relies on the output pin of the nested Action being an OutputPin rather 
						than an ActionOutputPin.
