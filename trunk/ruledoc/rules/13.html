				<h2>
					Rationale
				</h2>
					<p>
						'CallOperationAction is an action that transmits an operation call request to the target object, where it may cause the
						invocation of associated behavior.' The CallOperationAction is a type of AcceptEventAction, as is 
						<a href="../actions/sendSignalAction">Send Signal Action</a>. Where SendSignalAction sends an asynchronous message to a
						particular object, for the object to process as it chooses, CallOperationAction refers to a specific sequence of actions,
						defined as an Operation. The call may be synchronous or asynchronous. A synchronous call requires a ReplyAction to be 
						executed by the called object when the Operation completes, so that the calling object can return to its execution.
					</p>
					<p>
						This variation, like <a href="4.html">actorSendSignal</a>, mirrors the situation in which an external actor calls an operation
						inside one of the model's objects. Because the external actor does not have a defined state machine in the UML model, there is
						no CallOperationAction node to hold the various attributes of the Action required by the specification, and so only the effects
						of the execution are simulated. These are described in the UML Specification at <a href="../../UML_Superstructure_2-1-2_07-11-02.pdf#page=437">13.1</a>.
						Briefly, the execution of CallOperationAction generates an InvocationOccurrence event, which 'has' a message. That message is
						'sent' to the receiving object. When it arrives, it causes a CallOccurrence event, which also 'has' the message. The receiving
						object then responds to the CallOccurrence event depending on the attributes of the event and the information contained in the
						message.
					</p>
				<h2>
					Assumptions/Deviations from the Definition
				</h2>
					<p>
						As explained above, in this implementation there is no CallOperationAction node, and so the Action has no attributes.
						The correct Operation to execute is determined through the user's actions - what Operation they clicked on in the GUI
						representation of the object diagram. This is then marked with an "i" edge from the messageInstance to the Operation. 
						Further, the message holds no information. A full implementation would require a variant for both asynchronous and synchronous calls. <!-- Because in an asynchronous implementation
						the reply returns upon receipt and no information is sent back to the calling object, we are treating the above rule as sufficient 
						to mirror the effects. -->
