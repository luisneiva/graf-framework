				<h2>
					Rationale and Comments
				</h2>
					<p>
						'SendSignalAction is an action that creates a signal instance from its inputs, 
						and transmits it to the target object, where it may cause the firing of a state 
						machine transition or the execution of an activity.' The Action has two associations,
						a signal type that is to be sent, and a target (an input pin) that it is to be sent
						to.
					</p>
					<p>In this variation, the sender of the signal is an external actor - 'instance2' in the 
					rule diagram (generally the user in GRAF). The effect of the rule is to create a signal of
					the desired type (ie that which will trigger the transition between states) - '#c1', to 'send'
					the signal by creating a 'send event', and to accept a 'receipt' by creating a 'receipt event'.
					The send and receipt events create a bridge between the actor, the signal, and the recipient. 
					The effect is that instance1 receives the signal that causes it to transition.
