					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>AcceptCallAction is an accept event action representing the receipt of a synchronous call request. In addition to the
					normal operation parameters, the action produces an output that is needed later to supply the information to the
					ReplyAction necessary to return control to the caller.</p>
					<p>This action is for synchronous calls. If it is used to handle an asynchronous call, execution of the subsequent reply action
					will complete immediately with no effects.</p>
					<h3>Attributes</h3>
					<p>See <a href="acceptEventAction.html">AcceptEventAction</a>.</p>
					<h3>Associations</h3>
					<p>returnInformation: OutputPin[1..1]<br/>
					Pin where the value is placed containing sufficient information to perform a subsequent reply and return control to the
					caller. The contents of this value are opaque. It can be passed and copied but it cannot be manipulated by the model.</p>
					<h3>Constraints</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>The result pins must match the in and out parameters of the operation specified by the trigger event in number,
						type, and order.</li>
						<li>The trigger event must be a CallEvent.</li>
						<li>isUnmarshall must be true for an AcceptCallAction.</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Semantics</h3>
					<p>This action accepts (event) occurrences representing the receipt of calls on the operation specified by the trigger call
					event. If an ongoing activity behavior has executed an accept call action that has not completed and the owning object has
					an event occurrence representing a call of the specified operation, the accept call action claims the event occurrence and
					removes it from the owning object. If several accept call actions concurrently request a call on the same operation, it is
					unspecified which one claims the event occurrence, but one and only one action will claim the event. The argument
					values of the call are placed on the result output pins of the action. Information sufficient to perform a subsequent reply
					action is placed in the returnInformation output pin. The execution of the accept call action is then complete. This return
					information value is opaque and may only be used by ReplyAction.</p>
					<p>Note that the target class must not define a method for the operation being received; otherwise, the operation call will be
					dispatched to that method instead of being put in the event buffer to be handled by AcceptCallAction. In general, classes
					determine how operation calls are handled, namely by a method, by a behavior owned directly by the class, by a state
					machine transition, and so on. The class must ensure that the operation call is handled in a way that AcceptCallAction has
					access to the call event.</p>

				<h2>
					Discussion
				</h2>
					<p>
						As a specialization of AcceptEventAction, the implementation of CallOperationAction follows the pattern established by 
						the acceptEventAction rules. The naming conventions of those rules have been retained for ease of reference, although
						there are some differences. For example, AcceptCallAction does not require a 'SameState' variant. This is because (so far)
						we do not have an Operation that triggers a transition between states. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Please refer to the discussion of <a href="acceptEventAction">AcceptEventAction</a> for further discussion on the
						implementation of these Actions.
					</p>
