					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>Structural Features are potentially multi-valued and ordered, so the action supports
					specification of insertion points for new values. It also supports the removal of existing
					values of the structural feature before the new value is added.</p>
					<p>The object to access is specified dynamically, by referring to an input pin on which the
					object will be placed at runtime. The type of the value of this pin is the classifier that
					owns the specified structural feature, and the value's multiplicity is 1..1.</p>
					<h3>Attributes</h3>
					<p>isReplaceAll: Boolean [1..1] = false <br />
					Specifies whether existing values of the structural feature of the object should be removed
					before adding the new value.
					</p>
					<h3>Associations</h3>
					<p>insertAt: InputPin[0..1] <br />
					Gives the position at which to insert a new value or move an existing value in ordered
					structural features. The type of the pin is UnlimitedNatural, but the value cannot be zero.
					This pin is omitted for unordered structural features. (Subsets Action::input).
					</p>
					<h3>Constraints</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Actions adding a value to ordered structural features must have a single input pin
						for the insertion point with type UnlimitedNatural and multiplicity of 1..1; otherwise,
						the action has no input pin for the insertion point.</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Semantics</h3>
					<p>If isReplaceAll is true, then the existing values of the structural feature are removed before the new one added, except if
					the new value already exists, then it is not removed under this option. If isReplaceAll is false and the structural feature is
					unordered and unique, then adding an existing value has no effect. If the feature is an association end, the semantics are
					the same as creating a link, the participants of which are the object owning the structural feature and the new value.</p>
					<p>Values of a structural feature may be ordered or unordered, even if the multiplicity maximum is 1. Adding values to
					ordered structural features requires an insertion point for a new value using the insertAt input pin. The insertion point is
					a positive integer giving the position to insert the value, or unlimited, to insert at the end. A positive integer less than or
					equal to the current number of values means to insert the new value at that position in the sequence of existing values,
					with the integer one meaning the new value will be first in the sequence. A value of unlimited for insertAt means to insert
					the new value at the end of the sequence. The semantics is undefined for a value of zero or an integer greater than the
					number of existing values. The insertion point is required for ordered structural features and omitted for unordered
					structural features. Reinserting an existing value at a new position in an ordered unique structural feature moves the value
					to that position (this works because structural feature values are sets). The insertion point is ignored when replacing all
					values.</p>
					<p>The semantics is undefined for adding a value that violates the upper multiplicity of the structural feature. Removing a
					value succeeds even when that violates the minimum multiplicity - the same as if the minimum were zero. The modeler
					must determine when minimum multiplicity of structural features should be enforced.</p>
					<p>The semantics is undefined for adding a new value for a structural feature with isReadonly=true after initialization of the
					owning object.</p>
					<h3>Rationale</h3>
					<p>AddStructuralFeatureValueAction is introduced to add structural feature values. isReplaceAll is introduced to replace and
					add in a single action, with no intermediate states of the object where only some of the existing values are present.</p>
