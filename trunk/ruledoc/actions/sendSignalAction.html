					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>SendSignalAction is an action that creates a signal instance from its inputs, and transmits it to the target object, where it
					may cause the firing of a state machine transition or the execution of an activity. The argument values are available to the
					execution of associated behaviors. The requestor continues execution immediately. Any reply message is ignored and is
					not transmitted to the requestor. If the input is already a signal instance, use SendObjectAction.</p>
					<h3>Associations</h3>
					<p>signal: Signal [1]<br />
					The type of signal transmitted to the target object.</p>
					<p>target: InputPin [1]<br />
					The target object to which the signal is sent. {Subsets Action::input}</p>
					<h3>Constraints</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>The number and order of argument pins must be the same as the number and order of attributes in the signal.</li>
						<li>The type, ordering, and multiplicity of an argument pin must be the same as the corresponding attribute of the signal.</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Semantics</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>When all the prerequisites of the action execution are satisfied, a signal instance of the type specified by signal is
						generated from the argument values and this signal instance is transmitted to the identified target object. The target object
						may be local or remote. The signal instance may be copied during transmission, so identity might not be preserved. The
						manner of transmitting the signal object, the amount of time required to transmit it, the order in which the transmissions
						reach the various target objects, and the path for reaching the target objects are undefined.</li>
						<li>When a transmission arrives at a target object, it may invoke behavior in the target object. The effect of receiving a signal
						object is specified in 13, "Common Behaviors." Such effects include executing activities and firing state machine
						transitions.</li>
						<li>A send signal action receives no reply from the invoked behavior; any attempted reply is simply ignored, and no
						transmission is performed to the requestor.</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Rationale</h3>
					<p>Sends a signal to a specified target object.</p>
