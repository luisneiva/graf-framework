					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>
						CallOperationAction is an action that transmits an operation call request to the target object, where it may cause the
						invocation of associated behavior. The argument values of the action are available to the execution of the invoked
						behavior. If the action is marked synchronous, the execution of the call operation action waits until the execution of the
						invoked behavior completes and a reply transmission is returned to the caller; otherwise, execution of the action is
						complete when the invocation of the operation is established and the execution of the invoked operation proceeds
						concurrently with the execution of the calling behavior. Any values returned as part of the reply transmission are put on
						the result output pins of the call operation action. Upon receipt of the reply transmission, execution of the call operation
						action is complete.
					</p>
					<h3>Associations</h3>
					<h3>Constraints</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>The number of argument pins and the number of owned parameters of the operation of type in and in-out must be equal.</li>
						<li>The number of result pins and the number of owned parameters of the operation of type return, out, and in-out must be equal.</li>
						<li>The type, ordering, and multiplicity of an argument or result pin is derived from the corresponding owned parameter of the operation.</li>
						<li>The type of the target pin must be the same as the type that owns the operation.</li>
					</ol>
