					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>Every action is ultimately a part of some behavior, which is in turn optionally attached in some way to the specification
					of a classifier (for example, as the body of a method or as part of a state machine). When the behavior executes, it does
					so in the context of some specific host instance of that classifier. This action produces this host instance, if any, on its
					output pin. The type of the output pin is the classifier to which the behavior is associated in the user model.</p>
					<h3>Associations</h3>
					<p>result: OutputPin[1..1]<br />Gives the output pin on which the hosting object is placed.</p>
					<h3>Constraints</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>The action must be contained in a behavior that has a host classifier.</li>
						<li>If the action is contained in a behavior that is acting as the body of a method, then the operation
						of the method must not be static.</li>
						<li>The type of the result output pin is the host classifier.</li>
						<li>The multiplicity of the result output pin is 1..1.</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Semantics</h3>
					<p>Every action is part of some behavior, as are behaviors invoked by actions or other elements of behaviors. Behaviors
					are optionally attached in some way to the specification of a classifier.</p>
					<p>For behaviors that have no other context object, the behavior itself is the context object.</p>
					<h3>Rationale</h3>
					<p>ReadSelfAction is introduced to provide access to the context object when it is not available as a parameter.</p>
				</div>
				<h2>
					Discussion
				</h2>
					<p>
						The current implementation assumes that the 'context object' is an instance of a classifier. For that reason, it is
						also assumed that the the type of the object placed on the output pin will be that of the host classifier (see constraint
						3) but this is not explicitly provided for in the current rule.

					Below is the xml file which defines the order in which the rules are executed
