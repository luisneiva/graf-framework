				<h2>
					Rationale
				</h2>
					<p>
						'AcceptCallAction is an accept event action representing the receipt of a synchronous call request.'
						The overall application of this suite of rules is to generate a new behaviorExecution node in the instance
						whose operation has been called (as this rule does), and then add executable edges to all the actions contained
						in the method that implements the operation (done by <a href="16.html">acceptCallAction-WithActivity-ExecutableEdges</a>).
						This has the effect of allowing the user to 'execute' the actions contained in the method that was called. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Note that if we implement operations other than methods it may be wiser to generalise this rule than creating
						a whole new suite. This could possibly be done by making the edge names under Operation less specific.
					</p>
				<h2>
					Assumptions/Deviations from the Definition
				</h2>
					<p>
						Recall that executable edges are not part of the UML Specification - they are a convenient way for GRAF to keep track 
						of the actions still to be executed. See further the discussion of the <a href="../actions/acceptCallAction">AcceptCallAction</a> itself.
