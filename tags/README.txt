
Release 1

The focus of the first release was to specifically target the UML language to
create a UML reference animator. This project has since been redirected to allow
support for multiple language bases.

Release 2

The second release was implemented using a graph transformation engine prototype
that we developed. This project has since been integrated with the open-source
graph transformation engine AGG. For details of this engine, see:

Release 3

The third release is a stable release that includes integration with the graph
transformation engine AGG, and includes the necessary functionality to fully
animate our example UML model of a microwave.
